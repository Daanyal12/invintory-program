# invintory-program
This invintory program is my final capstone for level 1 python 
This program is an invintory manager it allows a business like nike to store all their stock in a data base represented as invintory.txt 
This program demonstrates how a invintory works by running in waterfall form this way the user gets an understanding of the all the functions in this program
the functions include
- read data (reads all the data in the data base)
- search for shoe codes (allows the user to search for a shoe based on its code)
- find lowest quantity (find the lowest quantity of shoes and allow user to restock it)
- find highest quantity (find the highest quantity of shoes and allow the user to put it on sale)
- value per item (this gets the total value per item )
- tabulate data (displays the data in a easy to read format)

once the program is finished and you want to run it again check that the invintory.txt is replaced with the original
